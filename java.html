    <h1> java programming language </h1><hr/>
    <p>In June 1991, James Gosling launched a Java language framework for use in one of his many experiments on the set-top box.<br> The language, originally called 'Oak' after an oak tree standing outside the office of Gosling, also went by the name 'Green' <br>And was later renamed Java, from a compilation of random terms.
In 1995 Sun released Java 1.0 as the first public implementation.<br> </p>
