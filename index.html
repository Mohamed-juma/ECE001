    <h3> programming languages History </h3>
    <p> A few years after the work of Von Neumann the language Short Code appeared in 1949 (www.byte.com). <br>This was the first programming language for electronic devices and involved a manual conversion of the programmer's statements into 0s and 1s. <br>This was, still, the first step towards today's complex languages. Grace Hopper had written the first compiler in 1951,<br> (www.byte.com). A compiler is a program which transforms statements of the language into 0's and 1's for the computer to understand. <br> It led to faster programming, as the programmer was no longer needed to do the work by hand.<br>
      The first of the major languages appeared in FORTRAN type in 1957. The name stands for program FORmula TRANslating. <br>The terminology for scientific computation was developed at IBM. The components were very basic, and made available<br> A programmer with low-level exposure to the innards of computers. Today it should be called the language <br>Restrictive as it contained only IF, DO and GOTO instructions, but those orders were a major step forward at the time.<br> The basic types of data used today began with FORTRAN, which included logical variables (TRUE or FALSE) and numbers of integer, true, and double-precision.</p>

    <h3> what is The syntax!!!.. </h3>
    <p>Code is written in a language which a machine is able to understand. The programming languages are hundreds of different,<br> We each have their own logic and their own syntax. A programming language has its own syntax, containing<br> Set of rules dictating how to bring together words and symbols to form a system.<br>
      In programming language the idea of syntax is close to the principles of grammar and spelling in spoken language.<br> If a sentence has very weak grammar and spelling in English, it is difficult to understand, or even impossible.<br> Similarly the program does not run when code has syntax errors.</p>
      <br>
    <h3>Statements </h3>
    <p> Statements are the fundamental unit of code. A declaration may assign a value to a variable,<br>Carry out a single operation, track the execution of other actions and do several other things.<br>A sentence is a single line of code which is doing something. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> Variables </h3>
    <p>Programming languages use variables. You can think of a variable as a container <br>in which you can store a value that can be retrieved at any time. In other words,<br> variables store information.Variable names can be just about anything,<br> but they typically cannot start with a number since the first part of the variable<br> would be confused with a number. Now you can do something with this string.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>Implementing a programming language provides the means to write and execute programs in that language <br>On one or more Hardware and Computer setups. Broadly speaking, there are<br> Two approaches to applying the programming language: compiling and decoding. Implementation is usually feasible <br>A language which uses both techniques. A compiler 's output can be implemented by hardware or a program called an interpreter.<br> In some implementations which use the interpreter approach <br>No distinct distinction exists between compilation and reading.</p>
